0.2 Patchnotes
==============
Alternative starting world: Acid Ocean (select "Void?World" as starting world, should be default)
    => This world is usefull to have no block placement / movement lag that
       occurs in void worlds typically when blocks above void are changed.
       
 Rain is now acid (withering) !
    => if you have animals better build them a house before you play with the new version !
       Antidote potion: protects temporary from rain
       Antidote Ring: Permanently protects from rain (only craftable in Composer)
       Note that these do not protect from acid ocean !

0.3 Preview
==================
- Worldtype "Void?World" (acid ocean) now spawns new players with lexica botania too
- Mekanism / Galacticraft tiered progression:
   x2 ore processing requires visting the moon (tier 1 rocket => meteoric iron)
   x3 ore processing requires visiting mars (tier 2 rocket => desh)
   x4 ore processing requires visiting venus and asteroids (tier 3 rocket => lead and titanium)
   x5 ore processing: no change until GC addon has been added (higher tier rockets/planets)
- Soulus dirt fossils are now generated with pureDaisy instead mana pool to lower the early game mana needed a bit.
- new acid ocean worlds now have no (toxic) rain the first three minecraft days. (in GOG worldtype it still can rain on day 1)

Planned mods (not sure yet if they will make it into 0.3): 
   Tinkers Construct, Buildcraft, some more Magic mods
