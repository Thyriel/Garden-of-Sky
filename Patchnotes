0.2 Patchnotes
==============
Alternative starting world: Acid Ocean (select "Void?World" as starting world, should be default)
    => This world is usefull to have no block placement / movement lag that
       occurs in void worlds typically when blocks above void are changed.
       
 Rain is now acid (withering) !
    => if you have animals better build them a house before you play with the new version !
       Antidote potion: protects temporary from rain

       Note that these do not protect from acid ocean !
